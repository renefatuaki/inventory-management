# Inventory Management

## üí° About

Inventory Management is a system designed for e-commerce platforms,
enabling internal employees to manage products, update inventories, and retrieve product details.
The focus is on implementing a RESTful API that provides CRUD operations for products.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

* **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.

### Configuration

1. **Ports Availability**:
    * Ensure that ports `8080` (for the API) and `5432` (for PostgreSQL) are available on your machine.

2. **Environment Variables**:
    * The necessary environment variables are predefined in the `.env` file located in the project root. Ensure this file exists and contains the correct
      configurations.

Execute the following command in your terminal to build and run the application:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:

* Build the Docker image for the API.
* Start the PostgreSQL database.
* Launch the API service.

## üöÄ Usage

Once the services are up and running, you can interact with the API using tools like curl or Postman.
